SmartAnthill 2.0 Embedded System
================================

SmartAnthill project is intended to operate on MCUs which are extremely resource-constrained. In particular, currently weâ€™re aiming to run SmartAnthill on MCUs with as little as 512 bytes of RAM. This makes the task of implementing SmartAnthill on such MCUs rather non-trivial. 

More detailed information is located in `Documentation <http://docs.smartanthill.org>`_.
