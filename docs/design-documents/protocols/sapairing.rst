SmartAnthill PAIRING procedure
==============================

:Version:   v0.0.5

*NB: this document relies on certain terms and concepts introduced in* :ref:`saoverarch` *and* :ref:`saprotostack` *documents, please make sure to read them before proceeding.*

"Pairing" SmartAnthill Device to SmartAnthill Client (which is normally located on SmartAnthill Central Controller) is necessary to ensure secure key exchange between SmartAnthill Device and SmartAnthill Client. As soon as "pairing" is completed, both parties have a 128-bit symmetric key shared between them, and can use it for SASP purposes.

SmartAnthill Pairing comes in several flavours. SmartAnthill Device MUST implement at least one of these flavours. SmartAnthill Client MUST implement *all* these flavours. 

SmartAnthill Pairing flavours currently include SmartAnthill Zero Pairing, and SmartAnthill Single-LED Pairing.

SmartAnthill Zero Pairing
-------------------------

SmartAnthill Zero Pairing applies only to those devices which can be completely reprogrammed by SmartAnthill Central Controller (usually it applies to SmartAnthill Hobbyist Devices). 

SmartAnthill Zero Pairing consists of:

* Client generating secret key (see TODO for details)
* Client preparing (e.g. compiling or linking) a program which includes generated secret key as static data
* Client storing generated secret key in SA DB
* Client programming Device using prepared program (which contains generated secret key)

TODO: restrictions on SmartAnthill Device programming-socket key access.

SmartAnthill ESSP
-----------------

ESSP stands for 'Even Simpler Secure Pairing'. ESSP protocol provides security with minimal complexity involved.

From security perspective, ESSP works as follows:

* BOTH parties generate 256-bit keys (see TODO for details)
* parties initiate anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange for generated 256-bit keys, obtaining a 256-bit shared key
* from this point on, SASP uses first 128-bits of 256-bit shared key, as SASP AES key
* parties use last 128 bits of the 256-bit shared key ("MITM check key") to perform MITM protection check depending on the flavour (during MITM protection check, SASP uses SASP AES key, but both parties keep a MITM-CHECK-IN-PROGRESS flag that this is not real work, and only SACCP programs with a special MITM-CHECK flag (TODO) are allowed to be executed).
* When MITM-CHECK-IN-PROGRESS flag is set, Zepto VM allows access (TODO) only to those BODYPARTS which are specially designated as "MITM-CHECK" ones.
* if MITM protection check indicates that everything is fine - MITM-CHECK-IN-PROGRESS flag is cleared, and normal work can be resumed.

ESSP Protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**ESSP PAIRING REQUEST**

Format: TODO. Comes from Client to Device; when ESSP PAIRING REQUEST/RESPONSE is passed over SASP, SASP uses 'zero AES key' (TODO). Contains protocol version number, Client Capabilities, and `g^a mod p`

ESSP PAIRING REQUEST and ESSP PAIRING REPLY go over SACCP over SAGDP (over SASP), forming a 2-packet "packet chain", so that delivery is guaranteed by SAGDP.

**ESSP PAIRING REPLY**

Format: TODO. Comes from Device to Client; when ESSP PAIRING REQUEST/RESPONSE is passed over SASP, SASP uses 'zero AES key' (TODO). Contains Device Capabilities, and `g^b mod p`.
TODO: error message?

**ESSP PAIRING MITM PROGRAM**

ESSP PAIRING PROGRAM is not really a special message. Instead, it is a regular Zepto VM program which goes over SACCP over SAGDP over SASP. SASP uses regular key (a part of 256-bit shared key from Diffie-Hellman exchange). There is a difference from regular program though: SACCP message for such a program contains a MITM-CHECK flag. Reply to such program is also designated with a MITM-CHECK flag. MITM-CHECK flag MUST match Device's own MITM-CHECK-IN-PROGRESS flag, otherwise it is a TODO error. MITM-CHECK flag disables access to all the bodyparts except the one which controls the LED, and enables built-in plugin which allows to calculate `BlinkingFunction()` as described below, and to reset Device's MITM-CHECK-IN-PROGRESS flag.

SmartAnthill Single-LED Pairing
-------------------------------

SmartAnthill Single-LED Pairing is pairing mechanism, which requires absolute minimum of resources on the Device side. Namely, all the Device needs to have (in addition to MCU) is one single LED. This LED MAY be any of existing LEDs on the Device. 

SmartAnthill Single-LED Pairing is based on Even Simpler Secure Pairing (ESSP) protocol, as described above. MITM Check for Single-LED Pairing is performed as follows:

* User is asked to bring Device close to the webcam which is located on SmartAnthill Central Controller
* Client sends a program which asks LED to blink, using `Binking-Function(random-nonce-sent-by-Client)=AES(key=random-nonce-sent-by-Client,data=MITM-check-key)` as a pattern. TODO: Built-in Plugin to produce AES(...) reply.
* Accordingly, Device starts blinking the LED
* Client, using webcam, recognizes blinking pattern and makes sure that it matches expectations.
* If expectations don't match, program may be repeated with a *different* random-nonce-sent-by-Client

NB: optionally, a webcam located on a smartphone, can be used for this purpose (provided that TODO requirements for securing communication between SmartAnthill Controller and smartphone's app, are met).

Single-LED Pairing being User-OPTIONAL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All SmartAnthill Devices MUST implement Single-LED Pairing. However, devices which are not designated as Security Devices, MAY set *both* LOW-SECURITY *and* PAIRING-USER-OPTIONAL flags in their Device Capabilities (TODO). If Client "pairs" with a Device which has *both* such flags set, it MAY ask user if he wants to perform "pairing". If at least one of the flags above is not set, Client MUST NOT allow to use Device (i.e. MUST NOT issue a program which resets MITM-CHECK-IN-PROGRESS Device flag, and MUST NOT send any non-pairing programs to the Device) until  "pairing" is actually performed.
