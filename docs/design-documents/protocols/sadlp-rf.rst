SmartAnthill DLP for RF (SADLP-RF)
==================================

:Version:   v0.2b

*NB: this document relies on certain terms and concepts introduced in* :ref:`saoverarch` *and* :ref:`saprotostack` *documents, please make sure to read them before proceeding.*

SADLP-RF provides L2 datalink over simple Radio-Frequency channels which have only an ability to send/receive packets over RF without any addressing. For more complicated RF communications (such as IEEE 802.15.4), different SADLP-\* protocols (such as SADLP-802.15.4 described in :ref:`sadlp-802-15-4`) need to be used.

SADLP-RF Design
---------------

Assumptions:

* We're assuming to operate in a noisy environment. Hence, we need to use forward error correction.
* error correction level is to be specified by an upper protocol layer for each packet separately (for example, retransmits may use higher error correction levels)
* We don't have enough resources to run sophisticated error-correction mechanisms such as Reed-Solomon, Viterbi, etc.
* Transmissions are rare, hence beacons and frequency hopping are not used
* upper protocol layer may have some use for packets where only a header is provided; hence upper layer provides it's header and it's payload separately

Non-paired Addressing for RF Buses
----------------------------------

Each RF frequency channel on a Device represents a "wireless bus" in terms of SAMP. For "intra-bus address" as a part "non-paired addressing" (as defined in :ref:`samp`), RF Devices MUST use randomly generated 64-bit ID. 

If Device uses hardware-assisted Fortuna PRNG (as described in :ref:`sarng` document), Device MUST complete Phase 1 of "Entropy Gathering Procedure" (as described in :ref:`sapairing` document) to initialize Fortuna PRNG *before* generating this 64-bit ID. Then, Device should proceed to Phase 2 (providing Device ID), and Phase 3 (entropy gathering for key generation purposes), as described in :ref:`sapairing` document.

SADLP-RF Packet
---------------

SADLP-RF packet has the following format:

**\| ENCODING-TYPE \| REPEATED-ENCODING-TYPE \| SADLP-RF-DATA \|**

where ENCODING-TYPE and REPEATED-ENCODING-TYPE are 1-byte fields (transmitted identical), with possible values being NO-CORRECTION, HAMMING-32-CORRECTION, and HAMMING-32-2D-CORRECTION.

NO-CORRECTION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For NO-CORRECTION packets, SADLP-RF-DATA has the following format:

**\| UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-LENGTH \| UPPER-LAYER-HEADER \| UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-CHECKSUM \| UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD-LENGTH \| UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD \| UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-AND-PAYLOAD-CHECKSUM \|**

where UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-LENGTH is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field specifying size of UPPER-LAYER-HEADER, UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-CHECKSUM is a 2-byte field containing SACHECKSUM-16 of UPPER-LAYER-HEADER, UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD-LENGTH is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field specifying size of UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD, and UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-AND-PAYLOAD CHECKSUM is a 2-byte field containing SACHECKSUM-16 of UPPER-LAYER-HEADER concatenated with UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD.

HAMMING-32-CORRECTION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For HAMMING-32-CORRECTION packets, SADLP-RF-DATA is **\| UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-WITH-HAMMING-32 \| UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD-WITH-HAMMING-32 \|**

where UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-WITH-HAMMING-32 and UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD each is represented by a sequence of 4-byte HAMM32 error-correctable blocks (out of each 4-byte block 26 bits are reconstructed). Each HAMM32 block is a 31-bit Hamming block (as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code), with prepended total block parity bit p0 (making HAMM32 a 32-bit SECDED code).

To produce UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-WITH-HAMMING-32 from UPPER-LAYER-HEADER, the following procedure is used:

* If UPPER-LAYER-HEADER have size which is not a multiple of 26-bit, it is padded with random data (using non-key random stream as specified in :ref:`sarng`). 
* resulting bit sequence is split into 26-bit chunks, and each 26-bit chunk is converted into a 32-bit HAMM32 block
* UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-WITH-HAMMING-32 is a sequence of resulting 32-bit HAMM32 blocks

To produce UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD-WITH-HAMMING-32 from UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD, the procedure is exactly the same.

UPPER-LAYER-HEADER has the following format:

**\| UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-LENGTH \| UPPER-LAYER-HEADER \| UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-CHECKSUM \|**

where UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-LENGTH is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field specifying size of UPPER-LAYER-HEADER, and UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-CHECKSUM is a 2-byte field containing SACHECKSUM-16  of UPPER-LAYER-HEADER.

UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD has the following format:

**\| UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD-LENGTH \| UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD \| UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-AND-PAYLOAD-CHECKSUM \|**

where UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD-LENGTH is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field specifying size of UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD, and UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-AND-PAYLOAD CHECKSUM is a 2-byte field containing SAHECKSUM-16 of UPPER-LAYER-HEADER concatenated with UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD.

HAMMING-32-2D-CORRECTION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HAMMING-32-2D-CORRECTION is similar to HAMMING-32-CORRECTION, with the following differences.

Both UPPER-LAYER-HEADER-WITH-HAMMING-32 and UPPER-LAYER-PAYLOAD-WITH-HAMMING-32 have 26 additional Hamming checksums added at the end; each Hamming checksum #i consists of N parity bits of Hamming code, calculated over all bits #i in 26-bit data bits within HAMM32 blocks. Number N is a number of Hamming bits necessary to provide error correction for NN=NUMBER-OF-HAMM32-BLOCKS. Hamming checksums are encoded as a bitstream, without intermediate padding, but padded at the end to a byte boundary with random (non-key-stream) data.

For example, if original block is 50 bytes long, then it will be split into 16 26-bit blocks, which will be encoded as 16 HAMM32 blocks; then, for HAMMING-32-2D-CORRECTION, additional 26 Hamming checksums (5 bits each, as for NN=16 N=5) will be added. Therefore, original 50 bytes will be encoded as 4*16+17=81 byte (62% overhead).
