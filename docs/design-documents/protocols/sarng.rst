SmartAnthill SmartAnthill Random Number Generation and Key Generation
=====================================================================

:Version:   v0.1.1

*NB: this document relies on certain terms and concepts introduced in* :ref:`saoverarch` *and* :ref:`saprotostack` *documents, please make sure to read them before proceeding.*

Random Number Generation is vital for ensuring security. This document describes requirements for Random Number Generation for SmartAnthill Devices.

Poor-Man's PRNG
---------------

Each device with Poor-Man's PRNG, has it's own AES-128 secret key (this key MUST NOT be stored outside of the device), and additionally keeps a counter. This counter MUST be kept in a way which guarantees that the same value of the counter is never reused; this includes both having counter of sufficient size, and proper commits to persistent storage to avoid re-use of the counter in case of accidental device reboot. As for commits to persistent storage - two such implementations are discussed in :ref:`sasp` document, in 'Implementation Details' section, with respect to storing nonces.

Then, Poor-Man's PRNG simply encrypts current value of the counter with AES-128, increments counter (see note above about guarantees of no-reuse), and returns encrypted value of the counter as next 16 bytes of the random output.

Devices with pre-initialized Poor-Man's PRNG
--------------------------------------------

Resource-constrained SmartAnthill Devices which don't have their own crypto-safe RNG, MUST use Poor-Man's PRNG. On such Devices, Poor-Man's PRNG MUST be pre-initialized with a random key and random initial counter, generated outside of Device. Both key and counter MUST be crypto-safe random numbers.

Such Devices are known as Unique Devices.

Devices with hardware-based entropy source
------------------------------------------

If Device doesn't have a pre-initialized Poor-Man's PRNG, it is known as Hardware-Entropy-Only-Based Device. For such Hardware-Entropy-Only-Based Devices the following applies:

* Device MUST still implement Poor-Man's PRNG, it is just not pre-initialized
* Device MUST have a hardware entropy source, which provides a hardware-generated bit stream
* Device MUST implement on-line testing of hardware-generated bit stream (monobit test, poker test, runs test, and long runs test, as they were specified in FIPS140-2 after Change Notice 1 and before Change Notice 2; testing should be performed on each 20000-bit block before this block is fed to Fortuna; if the test fails - another block MAY be taken; if the test fails on 3 blocks in a row - it is considered a hardware RNG failure), with a catastrophic Device failure if the test fails before at least required Poor-Man's RNGs are initialized
* on-line testing MUST be performed on a bit stream before any cryptographic primitives are applied (but SHOULD be performed after von Neumann bias removal)
* Device MUST implement Fortuna RNG (as specified in TODO; note that Fortuna is very resource-intensive for an MCU). 
* hardware-generated bit stream MUST be fed to a Fortuna PRNG (after 20000-bit blocks pass on-line testing)
* RNG MUST skip at least first TODO bits of the Fortuna output bit stream (before starting using Fortuna output), after each Device reset/reboot
* on Device start, after skipping required amount of Fortuna output as specified above, and after performing all the additional Entropy-Needed - Entropy-Provided exchanges as specified in :ref:`sapairing` document, Device SHOULD initialize Poor-Man's PRNG with Fortuna's output. As soon as Poor-Man's PRNGs are initialized:

  + regardless of hardware RNG failures, to obtain one byte of output bit stream, RNG MUST take one byte from Fortuna output, and XOR it with one byte of Poor-Man's PRNG output 
  + as long as hardware RNG doesn't fail (i.e. blocks do pass on-line testing as described above), Poor-Man's PRNG SHOULD be re-initialized approx. once per one hour of work (exact times MAY vary depending on typical Device patterns), by XOR-ing it's counter with next 128 bits of Fortuna output

In addition, such Devices MUST perform additional Entropy-Needed requests during pairing procedure, as described in :ref:`sapairing` document.

Devices with both pre-initialized Poor-Man's PRNG and hardware-based entropy source
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Device has both pre-initialized Poor-Man's PRNG and hardware-based entropy source (which is RECOMMENDED whenever feasible):

* such Devices are known as Unique-Hardware-Entropy-Based Devices
* implementing on-line testing is not necessary
* Device MUST implement Fortuna RNG
* hardware-generated bit stream MUST be fed to a Fortuna PRNG
* RNG MUST skip at least first TODO bits of the Fortuna output bit stream, after each Device reset/reboot
* to obtain one byte of output bit stream, RNG MUST take one byte from Fortuna output, and XOR it with one byte of Poor-Man's PRNG output

SmartAnthill Client and Devices with Crypto-Safe RNG
----------------------------------------------------

Even if the system where the SmartAnthill stack is running, has a supposedly crypto-safe RNG (such as built-in crypto-safe /dev/urandom), SmartAnthill implementations still SHOULD employ Poor-Man's PRNG (as described above) in addition to system-provided crypto-safe PRNG. In such cases, each byte of SmartAnthill RNG (which is provided to the rest of SmartAnthill) SHOULD be a XOR of 1 byte of system-provided crypto-safe PRNG, and 1 byte of Poor-Man's PRNG. 

The same procedure SHOULD also be used for generating random data which is used for SmartAnthill key generation. 

*Rationale. This approach allows to reduce the impact of catastrophic failures of the system-provided crypto-safe PRNG (for example, it would mitigate effects of the Debian RNG disaster very significantly).*

TODO: define key generation for Poor-Man's PRNG in this case

Key Generation
--------------

For Devices which support OtA Pairing (see :ref:`sapairing` document for details), keys need to be generated. For such Devices the following requirements MUST be met:

* if Device doesn't have hardware-based entropy source:

  + Device MUST implement at least two pre-initialized Poor-Man's PRNGs: one of them (named 'POORMAN4KEYS') MUST NOT be used for any purposes except for key generation as described below. Another one (named 'NONKEYPOORMAN') is used to produce 'non-key Random Stream'.
  + in addition, Device MUST have an additional pre-initialized key (KEY4KEYS), which MUST NOT be used except for key generation as described below
  + to generate 128 bits of key, the following procedure applies:

    - take 16 random bytes received from the Client side (see description of Pairing-Request in :ref:`sapairing` for details), as ENTROPY
    - calculate `output=AES(key=KEY4KEYS,AES(key=POORMAN4KEYS.Random16bytes(),data=ENTROPY))`

* if Device does have a hardware-based entropy source but doesn't have pre-initialized keys:

  + Device MUST implement at least Poor-Man's PRNGs (they're not pre-initialized; initialization is described below): one of them (named 'POORMAN4KEYS') MUST NOT be used for any purposes except for key generation as described below. Another one (named 'NONKEYPOORMAN') is used for other purposes. Both Poor-Man's PRNGs MUST be initialized right after Device first start, as described above
  + as described above, Device MUST implement Fortuna RNG (feeding hardware entropy to Fortuna as described above)
  + to generate 128 bits of key, the following procedure applies:

    - take 16 random bytes received from the Client side (see description of Pairing-Request in :ref:`sapairing` for details), as ENTROPY
    - if on-line hardware-based testing indicates that the hardware entropy is ok:

      * feed ENTROPY to Fortuna generator (the same instance of Fortuna as described above for such devices)
      * calculate `output=Fortuna.Random16Bytes()`

    - if on-line hardware-based testing indicates that the hardware entropy has failed:

      * calculate `output=AES(key=POORMAN4KEYS.Random16bytes(),data=ENTROPY)`

* if Device has both pre-initialized keys and hardware-based entropy source:

  + Device MUST implement at least two pre-initialized Poor-Man's PRNGs: one of them (named 'POORMAN4KEYS') MUST NOT be used for any purposes except for key generation as described below. Another one (named 'NONKEYPOORMAN') is used to produce 'non-key Random Stream'.
  + in addition, Device MUST have an additional pre-initialized key (KEY4KEYS), which MUST NOT be used except for key generation as described below
  + to generate 128 bits of key, the following procedure applies:

    - take 16 random bytes received from the Client side (see description of Pairing-Request in :ref:`sapairing` for details), as ENTROPY
    - calculate `output=Fortuna.Random16bytes() XOR AES(key=KEY4KEYS,AES(key=POORMAN4KEYS.Random16bytes(),data=ENTROPY))`

Non-Key Random Stream
---------------------

SmartAnthill RNG provides a 'non-key Random Stream' for various purposes such as padding etc. Generation of 128 bits of non-key Random Stream is similar to key generation described above, with the following differences:

* instead of POORMAN4KEYS Poor-Man's PRNG, for 'non-key Random Stream' NONKEYPOORMAN is used
* a 16-byte pre-defined block of data (for example, one may use macro containing something like `memset(ptr,0,16);*(uint16*)ptr=__LINE__;memcpy((char*)ptr+2,8,__TIME__);` to initialize such a block) is used instead of ENTROPY
