SmartAnthill DLP for IEEE 802.15.4 (SADLP-802.15.4)
===================================================

:Version:   v0.1a

*NB: this document relies on certain terms and concepts introduced in* :ref:`saoverarch` *and* :ref:`saprotostack` *documents, please make sure to read them before proceeding.*

SADLP-802.15.4 provides L2 datalink over IEEE 802.15.4, suitable for use by SmartAnthill protocol stack in general, and by SAMP (see :ref:`samp` for details) in particular.

All references to IEEE 802.15.4 standard in this document, marked as [802.15.4], refer to IEEE Std 802.15.4(tm)‐2011, 
"IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks—Part 15.4: Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs)" (which can be obtained at http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.15.4-2011.pdf ).

***NB: to be taken with a grain of salt. If there are any issues with implementing it - let's discuss.***

*NB2: current version of SADLP-802-15-4 is very basic, and doesn't utilize some potentially useful features of IEEE 802.15.4; this is intended to be corrected in the future versions of SADLP-802-15-4. Such features include: uni-cast packets where applicable, security and ACK at 802.15.4 level.*

IEEE 802.15.4 Topology, PANs, and Beacons
-----------------------------------------

Current version of SADLP-802.15.4 uses peer-to-peer topology as defined in [802.15.4]. The node with the shortest SAMP distance from Root Node (TODO: define better) becomes "PAN coordinator" as defined in [802.15.4]. Normally, all the 802.15.4 Devices within one SmartAnthill network represent one single 802.15.4 PAN; however, in some cases (different channel frequencies or different collision domains) 802.15.4 Devices within the same SmartAnthill network MAY belong to different 802.15.4 PANs (therefore using different 802.15.4 PAN IDs, and having different PAN coordinators). PAN ID for this PAN (these PANs where applicable) SHOULD be chosen according to [802.15.4].

Current version of SADLP-802.15.4 doesn't use beacons. I.e. the 802.15.4 PAN is nonbeacon-enabled, as defined in [802.15.4]. 

IEEE 802.15.4 MAC Frames
------------------------

Each of SADLP-802-15-4 upper-layer-protocol packets (usually SAMP packets) is transmitted as 802.15.4 MAC frame (as described in [802.15.4] 5.2.1) with the following field values:

* Frame Control Field: 

  + Frame Type = 'Data Frame'
  + Security Enabled = false
  + Frame Pending = <depending on more data available; when required so by [802.15.4] 5.2.1.1.3, shall be set to zero>
  + Acknowledgment Request = false
  + PAN ID Compression = false
  + Destination Addressing Mode = 0b10 ('16-bit')
  + Frame Version = 0x01 ('post-2003 802.15.4')
  + Source Addressing Mode = 0b00 ('not present')

* Sequence Number Field: current value of macDSN, as specified in [802.15.4] 5.2.2.2.1
* Destination PAN Identifier: 0xffff
* Destination Address: 0xffff
* Source PAN Identifier/Source Address: not present
* Auxiliary Security Header: not present
* Frame Payload: SADLP payload (TODO: exactly or some massaging is needed?)
* FCS: 16-bit ITU-T CRC, as specified in [802.15.4]

That is, current version of the SADLP-802-15-4 sends all the data as unacknowledged (acknowledgement is handled by SAMP) insecure (security is provided by SASP) broadcast IEEE 802.15.4 data frame. 

Mapping to specific APIs
------------------------

Mapping to specific APIs implementing IEEE 802.15.4, is beyond the scope of this document. Any implementation which produces MAC frames with the fields above, should be ok.
