SmartAnthill Mesh Protocol (SAMP)
=================================

**EXPERIMENTAL**

:Version:   v0.0.14

*NB: this document relies on certain terms and concepts introduced in* :ref:`saoverarch` *and* :ref:`saprotostack` *documents, please make sure to read them before proceeding.*

SAMP is a part of SmartAnthill 2.0 protocol stack (TODO: insert). It belongs to Level 3 of OSI/ISO Network Model, and is responsible for routing packets within SmartAnthill mesh network.

SmartAnthill mesh network is a heterogeneous network. In particular, on the way from SmartAnthill Central Controller to SmartAnthill Device a packet may traverse different bus types (including all supported types of wired and wireless buses); the same stands for the packet going in the opposite direction.

SAMP is optimized based on the following assumptions:

* SAMP relies on all communications being between Central Controller and Device (no Device-to-Device communications)
* SAMP aims to optimize "last mile" traffic (between last Retransmitting Device and target Device) while paying less attention to Central-Controller-to-Retransmitting-Device and Retransmitting-Device-to-Retransmitting-Device traffic. This is based on the assumption that the Retransmitting Devices usually have significantly less power restrictions (for example, are mains-powered rather than battery-powered).
* SAMP combines data with route requests
* SAMP allows to send "urgent" data packets, which sacrifice traffic and energy consumption for the best possible delivery speed
* SAMP relies on upper-layer protocol (SAGDP) to send retransmits in case if packet has not been delivered, and to provide SAMP with an information about retransmit number (i.e., original packet having retransmit-number=0, first retransmit having retransmit-number=1, and so on).
* SAMP relies on upper-layer protocol (SAGDP) to provide information if the Device on the other side is required to have it's transmitter on for upper-layer protocol purposes. For SAGDP, there are states which do guarantee this (in fact, it stands in almost all SAGDP states except for IDLE).

SAMP has the following types of actors: Root (normally implemented by Central Controller), Retransmitting Device, and non-Retransmitting Device. All these actors are collectively named Nodes.

Underlying Protocol Requirements
--------------------------------

SAMP underlying protocol (normally SADLP-\*), MUST support the following operations:

* bus broadcast (addressed to all the Devices on the bus)
* bus multi-cast (addressed to a list of the Devices on the bus)
* bus uni-cast

NB: in many cases, these operations may be simulated using very few operations as primitives; for example, PHY-level broadcast can be used to create SADLP-\*-level multi-cast by adding, for example, NEXT-HOP-NODE-ID.

All SmartAnthill Devices SHOULD, and all SmartAnthill Retransmitting Devices MUST implement some kind of collision avoidance (at least CSMA/CA, a.k.a. "listen before talk with random delay").

Underlying Protocol Checksums
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When passing a packet to it's underlying protocol, SAMP MUST pass information which part of SAMP packet is SAMP header. Underlying protocol SHOULD provide separate checksums (and maybe separate error correction mechanisms) for SAMP-header and the-rest-of-SAMP-packet. In general, after applying error-correction: for SAMP-header 16-bit checksum of reasonable quality (such as CRC-16 or some kind of crypto-checksum truncated to 16 bits) is sufficient; for the-rest-of-SAMP-packet (or for the whole packet) an additional checksum MAY be applied (to ensure fast between-hop retransmit in case of error, opposed to waiting for SASP end-to-end checksum to be verified). In addition, underlying protocol MAY use "stronger" error correction for header than for the-rest-of-SAMP-packet.

Underlying Protocol MUST report partially correct packets (those with SAMP-header checksum correct but the-rest-of-SAMP-packet incorrect); SAMP SHOULD use such headers in "promiscuous mode" operations, and in some other cases labeled as "partially correct packet".

Promiscuous Mode Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wherever possible (in particular, for all kinds of wireless communications unless explicitly prohibited by underlying standard), SmartAnthill Retransmitting Devices SHOULD listen the network in promiscuous mode; this doesn't affect security, but provides valuable header information and speeds up message delivery and recovery in certain practical cases.

SmartAnthill Retransmitting Devices
-----------------------------------

Some SmartAnthill Devices are intended to be "SmartAnthill Retransmitting Devices". "SmartAnthill Retransmitting Device" has one or more transmitters. Transmitters on SmartAnthill Retransmitting Devices MUST be always-on; turning off transmitter is NOT allowed for SmartAnthill Retransmitting Devices. That is, if MCUSLEEP instruction is executed on a SmartAnthill Retransmitting Device, it simply pauses executing a program, without turning transmitter off (TODO: add to Zepto VM). Normally, SmartAnthill Retransmitting Devices are mains-powered, or are using large batteries. SmartAnthill Protocol Stack (specifically SAMP) on SmartAnthill Retransmitting Devices requires more resources (specifically RAM) than non-Retransmitting Devices.

Highly mobile Devices SHOULD NOT be Retransmitting Devices. Building a reliable network out of highly mobile is problematic from the outset (and right impossible if these movements are not synchronized). Therefore, SAMP assumes that Retransmitting Devices are moved rarely, and is optimized for rarely-moving Retransmitting Devices. While SAMP does recover from moving one or even all Retransmitting Devices, this scenario is not optimized and recovery from it may take significant time.

Routing Tables
--------------

Each Retransmitting Device, after pairing, MUST keep a Routing Table. Routing Table consists of two lists: (a) Links list, with each entry being (LINK-ID,BUS-ID,INTRA-BUS-ID,NEXT-HOP-ACKS,LINK-DELAY-UNIT,LINK-DELAY,LINK-DELAY-ERROR) tuple, and (b) Routes list, with each entry being (TARGET-ID,LINK-ID). LINK-ID is an intra-Routing-Table id, used to map routes into links.

Each entry in Routes list has semantics of "where to route packet addressed to TARGET-ID". In Links list, INTRA-BUS-ID=NULL means that the entry is for an incoming link. Incoming link entries are relatiely rare, and are used to specify LINK-DELAYs.

NEXT-HOP-ACKS is a flag which is set if the nearest hop (over (BUS-ID,INTRA-BUS-ID)) is known to be able not only to receive packets, but to send ACKs back via "bus uni-cast with ACK" SADLP-\* operation; in general, NEXT-HOP-ACKS cannot be calculated based only on bus type, and may change for the same link during system operation; SAMP is built to try using links with NEXT-HOP-ACKS as much as possible, but MAY use links without NEXT-HOP-ACKS if there are no alternatives.

TODO: size reporting to Root (as # of unspecified 'storage units', plus sizes of Links entry and Routes entry expressed in the same 'storage units'). 

Routing Tables SHOULD be stored in a 'canonical' way (Links list ordered from lower LINK-IDs to higher ones, Routes list ordered from lower TARGET-IDs to higher ones; duplicate entries for the same LINK-ID are prohibited, for the same TARGET-ID are currently prohibited); this is necessary to simplify calculations of the Routing Table checksums. TODO: specify Routing-Table-Checksum calculation

On non-Retransmitting Devices, Routing Table is rudimentary: it contains only one Link (LINK-ID=0,BUS-ID,INTRA-BUS-ID,...) and only one Route (TARGET-ID=0,LINK-ID=0). Moreover, on non-Retransmitting Devices Routing Table is OPTIONAL; if non-Retransmitting Device does not keep Routing Table - it MUST be reflected in a TODO CAPABILITIES flag during "pairing"; in this case Root MUST send requests to such devices specifying TODO header extension (which contains BUS-ID,INTRA-BUS-ID for the first hop back from target Device).

All Routing Tables on both Retransmitting and non-Retransmitting Devices are essentially copies of "Master Routing Tables" which are kept on Root. It is a responsibility of Root to maintain Routing Tables for all the Devices (both Retransmitting and non-Retransmitting); it is up to Root which entries to store in each Routing Table. In some cases, Routing Table might need to be truncated; in this case, it is responsibility of Root to use VIA field in Target-Address (see below) to ensure that the packet can be routed given the Routing Tables present. In any case, Routing Table MUST be able to contain at least one entry, with TARGET-ID=0 (Root). This guarantees that path to Root can always be found without VIA field.

In addition, on Rentransmitting Devices the following parameters are kept (and updated by Root): MAX-TTL, FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY-UNIT, FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY, NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY-UNIT, and NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY.

TODO: no mobile non-Retransmitting (TODO reporting 'mobile' in pairing CAPABILITIES, plus heuristics), priorities (low->high): non-Retransmitting, Retransmitting.

Addressing
----------

SAMP supports two ways of addressing devices: non-paired and paired. 

Non-paired addressing is used for temporary addressing Devices which are not "paired" with SmartAnthill Central Controller (yet). Non-paired addressing is used ONLY during "Pairing" process, as described in :ref:`sapairing` document. As soon as "pairing" is completed, Device obtains it's own SAMP-NODE-ID (TODO: add to pairing document), and all further communications with Device is performed using  "paired" addressing. Non-paired addressing is a triplet (NODE-ID,BUS-ID,INTRA-BUS-ID).

Paired addressing is used for addressing Devices which has already been "paired". It is always one single item SAMP-NODE-ID. Root always has SAMP-NODE-ID=0. 

DELAYs and DELAY-UNITs
----------------------

Whenever delay (or more generally - time interval) needs to be calculated, it is always represented as two fields: DELAY itself and corresponding DELAY-UNIT. 

To calculate delay for specific DELAY and DELAY-UNIT, the following formula is used (the formula as written is assumed to be in floating-point; other equivalent implementations are possible depending in particular on timer resolution for specific Device): `delay = 1 millisecond * DELAY * (2^DELAY_UNIT)`; that is, DELAY-UNIT=0 and DELAY=1 means 1 millisecond, DELAY-UNIT=1 and DELAY=1 means 2 milliseconds, and DELAY-UNIT =-2 and DELAY=1 means 0.25 milliseconds. 

Recovery Philosophy
-------------------

Recovery from route changes/failures is vital for any mesh protocol. SAMP does it as follows:

* by default, most of the transfers are not acknowledged at SAMP level (go as Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet without GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag)
* however, upper-layer protocol (normally SAGDP) issues it's own retransmits and passed retransmit number to SAMP
* on retransmit #N, SAMP switches GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag on
* when GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag is set, SAMP uses "bus unicast with ACK" underlying-protocol mode
* if "bus unicast with ACK" fails for M times (with exponentially increasing timeouts), link failure is assumed
* link failure (as described above) is reported to the Root, so it can initiate route discovery to the node on the other side of the failed link (using Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet)

  + if link failure is detected from the side of the link which is close to Root, link failure reporting is done by sending Routing-Error (which always come in GUARANTEED-DELIVERY mode) back to Root
  + if link failure is detected from the side of the link which is far from Root, link failure reporting is done by broadcasting Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet, which is then converted into Samp-Forward-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet (which is always sent in GUARANTEED-DELIVERY mode) by all Retransmitting Devices which have received it.

Storm Avoidance
---------------

To reduce number of induced collisions during broadcasts, a.k.a. "request storm" and "reply storm" (NB: avoiding "storms" is important even when CSMA/CA is present, because CSMA/CA provides only probabilistic success), SAMP supports two mechanisms: explicit time-based collision avoidance, and random-delay-based storm avoidance. 

Explicit Time-Based Storm Avoidance and Collision Domains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SAMP explicit time-based collision avoidance works as follows:

* to avoid "request storm": when performing a 'network flood' (using Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet), Root MAY specify explicit time delays for each node. 
* to avoid "reply storm": Root MAY specify FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY-\* parameters; whenever a Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet (these are essentially sent as "anybody who can hear this, forward it to Root"), is received by Retransmitting Node, each of receiving Retransmitting Nodes waits according to FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY before retransmitting.
* In addition (to avoid "storms" in general), each SAMP packet, MAY have a 'Collision-Domain' restrictions (i.e. "from t0-from-now to t1-from-now, don't transmit on Collision-Domain #CD); these restrictions specify . **Retransmitting Devices SHOULD monitor Collision-Domain headers in promiscuous mode and work accordingly, even if the packet is not addressed to this Retransmitting Device**.

Random-delay-based Storm Avoidance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If explicit time-based collision avoidance is not used, Retransmitting Devices MUST use random delays (based on NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY-UNIT and NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY) as specified below.

Target-Address, Multiple-Target-Addresses, and Multiple-Target-Addresses-With-Extra-Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Target-Address allows to store either paired-address, or non-paired address. Target-Address is encoded as 

**\| FLAG-AND-NODE-ID \| OPTIONAL-VIA-OR-INTRA-BUS-SIZE-AND-BUS-ID \| ... \| OPTIONAL-VIA-INTRA-BUS-SIZE-AND-BUS-ID \| OPTIONAL-CUSTOM-INTRA-BUS-SIZE \| OPTIONAL-INTRA-BUS-ID \|**

where FLAG-AND-NODE-ID-OR-BUS-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, where bit[0] is EXTRA_DATA_FOLLOWS flag, and bits[1..] are NODE-ID.

OPTIONAL-VIA-OR-INTRA-BUS-SIZE-AND-BUS-ID is present only if EXTRA_DATA_FOLLOWS is set, and is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, where bit[0] represents IS_NONPAIRED_ADDRESS flag, and the rest of the bits depend on bit[0]. If IS_NONPAIRED_ADDRESS flag is not set, then bits[1..] represent VIA field (encoded as `NODE-ID+1`); if VIA field is -1 (because bits[1..] are zero), then no further extra data fields are present. If IS_NONPAIRED_ADDRESS flag is set, then bits[1..3] represent INTRA-BUS-SIZE (with value 0x7 interpreted in a special way, specifying that INTRA-BUS-SIZE is 'custom'), and bits [4..] represent BUS-ID. If IS_NONPAIRED_ADDRESS flag is not set, and VIA field in it is >=0, it means that another OPTIONAL-VIA-INTRA-BUS-SIZE-AND-BUS-ID field is present, which is interpreted as above. OPTIONAL-VIA-INTRA-BUS-SIZE-AND-BUS-ID with either IS_NONPAIRED_ADDRESS set, or with VIA field equal to -1, denote the end of the list.

OPTIONAL-CUSTOM-INTRA-BUS-SIZE is present only if OPTIONAL-VIA-OR-INTRA-BUS-SIZE-AND-BUS-ID is present, and flag IS_NONPAIRED_ADDRESS is set, and INTRA-BUS-SIZE field has value 'custom'; OPTIONAL-INTRA-BUS-ID is present only if OPTIONAL-VIA-OR-INTRA-BUS-SIZE-AND-BUS-ID is present, and has INTRA-BUS-SIZE (calculated from OPTIONAL-INTRA-BUS-SIZE-AND-BUS-ID and OPTIONAL-CUSTOM-INTRA-BUS-SIZE) size.

Multiple-Target-Addresses is essentially a multi-cast address. It is encoded as a list of items, where each item is similar to an Target-Address field, with the following changes: 

* for list entries, within FLAG-AND-NODE-ID field it is `NODE-ID + 1` which is stored (instead of simple NODE-ID for single Target-Address). This change does not affect VIA fields.
* to denote the end of Multiple-Target-Addresses list, FLAG-AND-NODE-ID field with NONPAIRED_ADDRESS=0 and NODE-ID=0, is used
* value of FLAG-AND-NODE-ID field with NONPAIRED_ADDRESS=1 and NODE-ID=0, is prohibited (reserved)

Multiple-Target-Addresses-With-Extra-Data is the same as Multiple-Target-Addresses, but each item (except for the last one, where NODE-ID=0), additionally contains some extra data (which is specified whenever Multiple-Target-Addresses-With-Extra-Data is mentioned). For example, if we're speaking about "Multiple-Target-Addresses-With-Extra-Data, where Extra-Data is 1-byte field", it means that each item of the list (except for the last one) will have both Target-Address field (with changes described in Multiple-Target-Addresses), and 1-byte field of extra data.

Time-To-Live
------------

Time-To-Live (TTL) is a field which is intended to address misconfigured/inconsistent Routing Tables. TTL is set to certain value (default 4) whenever the packet is sent, and is decremented by each Node which retransmits the packet. TTL=0 is valid, but TTL < 0 is not; whenever the packet needs to be retransmitted and it would cause TTL to become < 0 - the packet is dropped (with a Routing-Error, see below).

During normal operation, it SHOULD NOT occur. Whenever the packet is dropped because TTL is down to zero (except for Routing-Error SAMP packets), it MUST cause a TODO Routing-Error to be sent to Root.

Uni-Cast Processing
-------------------

Whenever a Uni-Cast packet (the one with a Target-Address field) is received by Retransmitting Device, the procedure is the following:

* check if the Target-Address is intended for the Retransmitting Device

  + if it is - process the packet locally and don't process further

* if packet TTL is already equal to 0 - drop the packet and send Routing-Error to the Root (see Time-To-Live section above for details)
* decrement packet TTL
* using Routing Table, find next hop for the Target-Address

  + if next hop cannot be found for the Target-Address itself, but Target-Address contains VIA field(s) - try to find next hop based on each of VIA fields
  + if next hop cannot be found using Target-Address and all VIA field(s) - drop the packet and send TODO Routing-Error to the Root

* if any of VIA fields in the Target-Address is the same as the next hop - remove all such VIA fields from the Target-Address
* find bus for the next hop and send modified packet (see on TTL and VIA modifications above) over this bus

Guaranteed Uni-Cast
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As described in detail below, all SAMP uni-cast packet types, except for Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet without GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag and Samp-Loop-Ack-Packet, are sent in 'Guaranteed Uni-Cast' mode. 

Processing by Retransmitting Devices
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If packet is to be delivered to the next hop in 'Guaranteed' mode by Retransmitting Device, it is processed in the following manner:

If the packet already has LOOP-ACK extra header (see below), and next hop has NEXT-HOP-ACKS flag set in the Routing Table, then Retransmitting Device:

* sends Samp-Loop-Ack-Packet (see below) back to the requestor specified in LOOP-ACK extra header 
* removes LOOP-ACK extra header
* continues processing as specified below

If the next hop has NEXT-HOP-ACKS flag set in the Routing Table, the packet is sent using underlying protocol's "bus uni-cast with ACK". If this operation returns 'failure' (i.e. ACK wasn't received), SAMP retries it 5 (TODO) times (with exponentially increasing timeouts - TODO) - it is treated as 'Routing-Error'. In particular:

* if the packet has Root as Target-Address: 

  + packet Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet containing TBD Routing-Error as PAYLOAD (and with IS_ERROR flag set) is broadcasted
  + if possible, the packet which wasn't delivered, SHOULD be preserved (**TODO: what to do if it cannot be?**), and retransmitted as soon as route to the Root is restored

* if the packet has anything except for Root as Target-Address (and therefore is coming from Root):

  + packet Samp-Routing-Error containing TBD Routing-Error is sent (towards Root)
  + the packet which wasn't delivered, doesn't need to be preserved (TODO: identify packet which has been lost within Routing-Error)

If the packet doesn't have LOOP-ACK extra header, next hop doesn't have NEXT-HOP-ACKS flag set in the Routing Table, then Retransmitting Device:

* adds LOOP-ACK extra header (which is described below) to the packet (if it is not already present)
* sends modified packet using "bus unicast" operation
* and sets timer to TODO

  + if the sender doesn't receive Samp-Loop-Ack-Packet until timer expires - it retransmits the packet at SAMP level. 
  
    - if such attempts don't succeed for 5 (TODO) times (with exponentially increasing timeouts - TODO) - it is treated as 'Routing-Error' (the same way as described above, depending on packet having Root as a Target-Address).

If the packet already has LOOP-ACK extra header, and next hop doesn't have NEXT-HOP-ACKS flag set in the Routing Table, then Retransmitting Device:

* keeps LOOP-ACK extra header
* sends packet using "bus unicast" operation
* doesn't set any timers

LOOP-ACK on Destination
'''''''''''''''''''''''

If packet with LOOP-ACK extra header is received by destination Device, destination Device MUST send Samp-Loop-Ack-Packet back to the node specified in LOOP-ACK extra header. If destination Device is a non-Retransmitting Device, it will send Samp-Loop-Ack-Packet with Target-Address specified in LOOP-ACK, but to the next hop specified in Root's Routing Table entry. TODO: is it possible that Device doesn't have a route to Root yet? 

LOOP-ACK and Routing
''''''''''''''''''''

As LOOP-ACK currently doesn't support VIA routing, it means that Root MUST ensure that all the nodes on the "loop" route already know the routes without VIA fields; it applies both to the route from the loop beginning to the loop end, and back from the loop end to the loop beginning (as for request-response cycle, LOOP-ACKs go both directions). When speaking about 'back from the loop end to the loop beginning', it MUST be taken into account that, as specified above, non-Retransmitting Device will send a Samp-Loop-Ack-Packet in the direction of the Root (but with Target-Address equal to the address from LOOP-ACK extra header), so there MUST be an already-defined route from this next-hop-in-direction-of-Root to the loop beginning.

Multi-Cast Processing
---------------------

Whenever a Multi-Cast packet (the one with Multiple-Target-Addresses field) is processed by a Retransmitting Device, the procedure is the following:

* check if one of addresses within Target-Address is intended for the Retransmitting Device (TODO: if multiple addresses match the Retransmitting Device - it is a TODO Routing-Error, which should never happen)

  + if it is - process the packet locally (NB: Retransmitting Devices SHOULD schedule processing instead)
  + remove the address of the Retransmitting Device from Multiple-Target-Addresses
  
    - if Multiple-Target-Addresses became empty - don't process any further

* if packet TTL is already equal to 0 - drop the packet and send Routing-Error to the Root (see Time-To-Live section above for details)
* decrement packet TTL
* using Routing Table, find next hops for all the Devices on the list of Multiple-Target-Addresses (this search MUST include using VIA field(s) if present, see Uni-Cast Processing above)
* if at least one of the next hops is not found - send a TODO Routing-Error packet (one packet containing all Routing-Errors for incoming packet) to Root, and continue processing
* if any of VIA fields in any of the Multiple-Target-Addresses is the same as the next hop - remove all such VIA fields from the Multiple-Target-Addresses
* find buses for all next hops, forming next-hop-bus-list
* for each bus on next-hop-bus-list

  + if there is only a single next hop for this bus - send the modified packet to this bus using uni-cast bus addressing

  + if there is multiple next hops for this bus:

    - if the bus supports multi-casting - send the modified packet using multi-cast bus addressing over the bus. NB: bus broadcasts (without INTRA-BUS-ID) MUST NOT be used for this purpose to avoid unnecessary multiplying number of packets.
    - otherwise, send the modified packet using uni-cast bus addressing to each of the hops

Promiscuous Mode Processing
---------------------------

Retransmitting Devices SHOULD, wherever possible, to listen to all the packets in "promiscuous mode". It allows for the following processing:

* if Retransmitting Device hears a packet addressed (at underlying protocol level) to another ("next-hop") Retransmitting Device (which is not Root), and it has a RETRANSMIT-ON-NO-RETRANSMIT flag in Routing Table for the route entry for that Retransmitting Device, and after a TODO timeout it doesn't hear a retransmit (neither full nor "partially correct") by next retransmitting the same packet (TODO define "the same packet"), it MUST try to send a TODO packet to the next-hop Retransmitting Device (in "guaranteed mode") - receiving Device MUST forward the packet to the destination, and send (or attach as a Combined-Packet if the target is Root) a TODO Routing-Error to the Root. If this attempt by our Retransmitting Device doesn't succeed - our Retransmitting Device MUST send a TODO Routing-Error packet (containing the packet as a payload) to the Root.


OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS
-----------------------

Most of SAMP packets have OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS field. It has a generic structure, but interpretations depend on the packet type. More specifically, OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS is a sequence of the following items:

* **\| GENERIC-EXTRA-HEADER-FLAGS \|**

  where GENERIC-EXTRA-HEADER-FLAGS is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] indicating the end of OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADER list, bits[1..2] equal to 2-bit constant GENERIC_EXTRA_HEADER_FLAGS, and further bits interpreted depending on packet type:

  + bit[3]. If the packet type is any packet type except for Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet - the bit is MORE-PACKETS-FOLLOW flag. For Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet - RESERVED (MUST be zero)
  + bit[4]. If the packet type is Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet, Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet, or Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet - the bit is IS-PROBE flag. If the packet type is Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet or Samp-Forward-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet - the bit is IS_ERROR (indicating that PAYLOAD is in fact Routing-Error). For Samp-Route-Update-Packet - the bit is DISCARD-RT-FIRST (indicating that before processing MODIFICATIONS-LIST, the whole Routing Table must be discarded). For other packet types - RESERVED (MUST be zero)
  + bit[5]. If the packet type is Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet, the bit is an EXPLICIT-TIME-SCHEDULING flag. If the packet type is Samp-Route-Update-Packet, it is an UPDATE-MAX-TTL flag. For other packet types - RESERVED (MUST be zero)
  + bit[6]. If the packet type is Samp-Route-Update-Packet, the bit is an UPDATE-FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY flag. If the packet type is Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet - it is a TARGET-COLLECT-LAST-HOPS flag. For other packet types - RESERVED (MUST be zero)
  + bit[7]. If the packet type is Samp-Route-Update-Packet, the bit is an UPDATE-MAX-NODE-RANDOM-DELAY flag. For other packet types - RESERVED (MUST be zero)
  + bits [8..] - RESERVED (MUST be zeros)

* **\| GENERIC-EXTRA-HEADER-COLLISION-DOMAIN \| COLLISION-DOMAIN-ID-AND-FLAG \| COLLISION-DOMAIN-T0 \| COLLISION-DOMAIN-T1 \| ... \|**

  where GENERIC-EXTRA-HEADER-COLLISION-DOMAIN is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] indicating the end of OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADER list, bits[1..2] equal to 2-bit constant GENERIC_EXTRA_HEADER_COLLISION_DOMAIN, and bits [3..] equal to DELAY-UNIT; COLLISION-DOMAIN-ID-AND-FLAG is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0]=0 indicating the end of collision-domain list, bits[1..] being COLLISION-DOMAIN-ID; COLLISION-DOMAIN-T0 and COLLISION-DOMAIN-T1 are Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> fields specifying respectively beginning and end of the window ("from now") when COLLISION-DOMAIN-ID SHOULD NOT be disturbed.  There can be multiple GENERIC-EXTRA-HEADER-COLLISION-DOMAIN headers in the same packet.

  GENERIC-EXTRA-HEADER-COLLISION-DOMAIN is a special kind of header; on receiving it, each node SHOULD take information within into account, and SHOULD NOT transfer over corresponding COLLISION-DOMAIN-ID within specified time window. In addition, whenever Retransmitting Device retransmits such a packet, it MUST calculate `NEW-COLLISION-DOMAIN-T0 = MAX(0,OLD-COLLISION-DOMAIN-T0 - INCOMING-LINK-DELAY - OUTGOING-LINK-DELAY)` and `NEW-COLLISION-DOMAIN-T1 = MAX(0,OLD-COLLISION-DOMAIN-T1 - INCOMING-LINK-DELAY - OUTGOING-LINK-DELAY + INCOMING-LINK-DELAY-ERROR + OUTGOING-LINK-DELAY-ERROR)` and use `NEW-\*` values in the retransmitted packet; for calculating OLD-COLLISION-DOMAIN-\* parameters DELAY-UNIT field is used, \*-LINK-DELAY parameters together with their DELAY-UNITs are taken from corresponding entries in Routing Table; after doing these calculations, if both NEW-COLLISION-DOMAIN-T0 and NEW-COLLISION-DOMAIN-T1 become =0, this specific extra header SHOULD be dropped (i.e. not sent further).

* **\| UNICAST-EXTRA-HEADER-LOOP-ACK \| LOOP-ACK-ID \|**

  where UNICAST-EXTRA-HEADER-LOOP-ACK is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] indicating the end of OPTIONAL-EXTRA-DATA list, bits[1..2] equal to a 2-bit constant UNICAST_EXTRA_HEADER_LOOP_ACK, and bits[3..] representing NODE-ID of the address where to send the LOOP-ACK, and LOOP-ACK-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field representing ID of the LOOP-ACK to be returned. This extra header MUST NOT be present for packets other than Samp-Unicast-Packet.

* **\| TOSANTA-EXTRA-HEADER-LAST-INCOMING-HOP \|**

  where TOSANTA-EXTRA-HEADER-FLAGS is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] indicating the end of OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADER list, bits[1..3] equal to 3-bit constant TOSANTA_EXTRA_HEADER_LAST_INCOMING_HOP, and bits [5..] being node id. This extra header MUST NOT be present for packets other than Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet. There can be multiple TOSANTA-EXTRA-HEADER-LAST-INCOMING-HOP extra headers within single packet.

*NB: 2-bit extra header type constants MAY overlap as long as applicable types are different.*

SAMP Combined-Packet
--------------------

In general, SAMP passes SAMP Combined-Packets over underlying protocol. SAMP Combined-Packet consists of one or more SAMP Packets as described below; all SAMP Packets except for last one in SAMP Combined-Packet, have MORE-PACKETS-FOLLOW flag set (depending on the packet type, this flag is either passed as a part of the first field, or as a part of GENERAL-EXTRA-HEADERS-FLAGS, see details below).

SAMP Packets
------------

Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet: **\| SAMP-UNICAST-DATA-PACKET-FLAGS-AND-TTL \| OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS \| Target-Address \| OPTIONAL-PAYLOAD-SIZE \| PAYLOAD \|**

where SAMP-UNICAST-DATA-PACKET-FLAGS-AND-TTL is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] equal to 0, bit[1] being GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag, bit [2] being BACKWARD-GUARANTEED-DELIVERY, bit [3] being EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT, bit[4] being MORE-PACKETS-FOLLOW, and bits [5..] being TTL; OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS is present only if EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT flag is set and is described above; Target-Address is described above, OPTIONAL-PAYLOAD-SIZE is present only if MORE-PACKETS-FOLLOW flag is set, and is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field, and PAYLOAD is a payload to be passed to the upper-layer protocol.

If Target-Address is Root (i.e. =0), it MUST NOT contain VIA fields within; in addition, if Target-Address is Root (i.e. =0), the packet MUST NOT have BACKWARD-GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag set.

If IS-PROBE flag is set, then PAYLOAD is treated differently. When destination receives Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet with IS-PROBE flag set, destination doesn't pass PAYLOAD to upper-layer protocol. Instead, destination parses PAYLOAD as follows: **\| PROBE-TYPE \| OPTIONAL-PROBE-EXTRA-HEADERS \| PROBE-PAYLOAD \|** where PROBE-TYPE is 1-byte bitfield substrate, with bits [0..2] being either PROBE_UNICAST or PROBE_TO_SANTA, bit[3] being PROBE-EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT, and bits [4..7] reserved (MUST be zeros); OPTIONAL-PROBE-EXTRA-HEADERS are similar to OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS, and PROBE-PAYLOAD takes the rest of the PAYLOAD; if PROBE-TYPE==PROBE_UNICAST, then destination Device sends Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet back to Root, with PAYLOAD copied from PROBE-PAYLOAD, and extra headers formed from PROBE-EXTRA-HEADERS, "as if" this packet is sent in reply to IS-PROBE packet by upper layer, but adding IS-PROBE flag (as a part of GENERIC-EXTRA-FLAGS extra header). If PROBE-TYPE==PROBE_TO_SANTA, destination Device sends a Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet, with PAYLOAD copied from PROBE-PAYLOAD, "as if" the packet is sent in reply to IS-PROBE packet by upper layer, but adding IS-PROBE flag (as a part of GENERIC-EXTRA-FLAGS extra header).

Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet is processed as specified in Uni-Cast Processing section above; if GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag is set, packet is sent in 'Guaranteed Uni-Cast' mode. Processing at the target node (regardless of node type) consists of passing PAYLOAD to the upper-layer protocol.

When target Device receives the packet, and sends reply back, it MUST set GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag in reply to BACKWARD-GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag in original packet; this logic applies to all the packets, including 'first' packets in SAGDP "packet chain" (as they're still sent in reply to some SAMP packet coming from the Root).

If Retransmitting Device receives a "partially correct" Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet, addressed to itself, and it has NACK-PREV-HOP flag set for the source link within Routing Table, it MUST send a Samp-Nack-Packet back to the source of packet.

Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet: **\| SAMP-FROM-SANTA-DATA-PACKET-AND-TTL \| OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS \| LAST-HOP \| REQUEST-ID \| OPTIONAL-DELAY-UNIT \| MULTIPLE-RETRANSMITTING-ADDRESSES \| BROADCAST-BUS-TYPE-LIST \| Target-Address \| OPTIONAL-TARGET-REPLY-DELAY \| OPTIONAL-PAYLOAD-SIZE \| PAYLOAD \|**

where SAMP-FROM-SANTA-DATA-PACKET-AND-TTL is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0]=1, bits[1..3] equal to a 3-bit constant SAMP_FROM_SANTA_DATA_PACKET, bit [4] being EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT, and bits[5..] being TTL; OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS is present only if EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT is set, and is described above, LAST-HOP is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> representing node id of the last sender, REQUEST-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=4> field, OPTIONAL-DELAY-UNIT is present only if EXPLICIT-TIME-SCHEDULING flag is present, and is an Encoded-Signed-Int<max=2> field, which specifies units for subsequent DELAY fields (as described below), MULTIPLE-RETRANSMITTING-ADDRESSES is a Multiple-Target-Addresses-With-Extra-Data field described above (with Extra-Data being either empty if EXPLICIT-TIME-SCHEDULING flag is not present, or otherwise Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> DELAY field, using OPTIONAL-DELAY-UNIT field for delay calculations), BROADCAST-BUS-TYPE-LIST is a zero-terminated list of `BUS-TYPE+1` values (enum values for BUS-TYPE TBD), Target-Address is described above, OPTIONAL-TARGET-REPLY-DELAY has the same type as DELAY fields (and is absent if EXPLICIT-TIME-SCHEDULING flag is not present), and represents delay for the target Device (also using OPTIONAL-DELAY-UNIT field for delay calculations); OPTIONAL-PAYLOAD-SIZE is present only if MORE-PACKETS-FOLLOW flag is set, and is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field; PAYLOAD is a payload to be passed to the upper-layer protocol.

Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet is a packet sent by Root, which is intended to find destination which is 'somewhere around', but exact location is unknown. When Root needs to pass data to a Node for which it has no valid route, Root sends SAMP-FROM-SANTA-DATA-PACKET (or multiple packets), to each of Retransmitting Devices, in hope to find target Device and to pass the packet. 

Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet is processed as specified in Multi-Cast Processing section above, up to the point where all the buses for all the next hops are found; note that if Multi-Cast processing generates a Routing-Error, it is not transmitted immediately (see below). Starting from that point, Retransmitting Device processes Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet proceeds as follows: 

* replaces LAST-HOP field with it's own node id
* creates a list broadcast-bus-list of it's own buses which match BROADCAST-BUS-TYPE-LIST
* for each bus which is on a next-hop-bus list but not on the broadcast-bus-list - continue processing as specified in Multi-Cast Processing section above

  + transmission MUST NOT be made until time specified in DELAY field for current node, passes. If the time in DELAY field (after subtracting `(INCOMING-LINK-DELAY+OUTGOING-LINK-DELAY)` using their respective DELAY-UNITs) has already passed - node MUST introduce a random delay uniformly distributed from 0 to NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY parameter (using NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY-UNIT for calculations).
  + right before sending each modified packet - further modify all DELAY fields within MULTIPLE-RETRANSMITTING-ADDRESSES by subtracting `(INCOMING-LINK-DELAY+OUTGOING-LINK-DELAY)` (using their respective DELAY-UNITs). If resulting value is <0, it is made equal to 0.

* for each bus which is on the broadcast-bus-list - broadcast modified packet over this bus

  + transmission MUST NOT be made until time specified in DELAY field for current node, passes. If the time in DELAY field (after subtracting `(INCOMING-LINK-DELAY+OUTGOING-LINK-DELAY)` using their respective DELAY-UNITs) has already passed - node MUST introduce a random delay uniformly distributed from 0 to NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY parameter (using NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY-UNIT for calculations).
  + right before broadcasting each modified packet - further modify all DELAY (including TARGET-REPLY-DELAY) fields within MULTIPLE-RETRANSMITTING-ADDRESSES by subtracting `(INCOMING-LINK-DELAY+OUTGOING-LINK-DELAY)` (using their respective DELAY-UNITs). If resulting value is <0, it is made equal to 0.

If Retransmitting Device generates Routing-Error, then it MUST be delayed until time of TARGET-REPLY-DELAY + FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY (using corresponding DELAY-UNITs for calculations). If this time has already passed - Routing-Error is transferred with a random delay (from 0 to NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY, using NODE-MAX-RANDOM-DELAY-UNIT for calculations) from now.

On target Device, Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet waits until reply payload is ready (which is almost immediately if IS-PROBE is set, including 'discovery' packets, see below), then it is processed as follows:

* if TARGET-DELAY (expressed in DELAY-UNITs) has not passed yet, Device waits until it passes

  + if the incoming packet has TARGET-COLLECT-LAST-HOPS flag set (which is normally set for all the packets which have IS-PROBE flag), then target Device traces all the incoming packets addressed to it and having the same REQUEST-ID and makes a list extra-last-hops consisting of LAST-HOP headers from all of them
  + when sending Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet reply back, target Device adds LAST-INCOMING-HOP extra header for LAST-HOP within incoming packet, *plus* LAST-INCOMING-HOP headers for extra-last-hops (if such list exists, see above)

If IS-PROBE flag is set, then PAYLOAD is treated differently. When destination receives Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet with IS-PROBE flag set, destination doesn't pass PAYLOAD to upper-layer protocol. Instead, destination processes the packet in the same way as described for the processing of Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet with IS-PROBE flag set. A special case of Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet with IS-PROBE set is when Target-Address is Root (=0). Such packets (a.k.a. 'discovery' packets) are ignored by Root, but are replied to only by Devices which are not paired yet (i.e. have no node id). All such 'discovery' packets with Target-Address=0 MUST have IS-PROBE flag set.

Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet: **\| SAMP-TO-SANTA-DATA-OR-ERROR-PACKET-NO-TTL \| OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS \| OPTIONAL-PAYLOAD-SIZE \| PAYLOAD \|**

where SAMP-TO-SANTA-DATA-OR-ERROR-PACKET-NO-TTL is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0]=1, bits[1..3] equal to a 3-bit constant SAMP_TO_SANTA_DATA_OR_ERROR_PACKET, bit[5] being EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT, and bits [5..] reserved (MUST be zero); OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS is present only if EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT is set, and is described above. Note that Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet doesn't contain TTL (as it is never retransmitted 'as is'); OPTIONAL-PAYLOAD-SIZE is present only if MORE-PACKETS-FOLLOW flag is set, and is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field; PAYLOAD is either data or error data depending on IS_ERROR flag; if IS_ERROR flag is set - PAYLOAD format is the same as the body (after OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS) of Samp-Routing-Error-Packet.

Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet is a packet intended from Device (either Retransmitting or non-Retransmitting) to Root. It is broadcasted by Device in several cases: 

* when the message is marked as Urgent by upper-layer protocol
* when Device needs to report Routing-Error to Root when it has found that Root is not directly accessible.
* when requested to do so via a packet with IS-PROBE flag and PROBE-TYPE==PROBE_TO_SANTA

In any case, if Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet is sent in response to a Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet flag (regardless of packet being first or not from SAGDP point of view), Device MUST provide TOSANTA-EXTRA-HEADER-LAST-INCOMING-HOP extra header, filling it from LAST-HOP field of the Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet.

On receiving Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet, Retransmitting Device sends a Samp-Forward-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet towards Root, in 'Guaranteed Uni-Cast' mode. To avoid congestion at this point, each Retransmitting Device delays according for FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY (using FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY-UNIT for calculations), where FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY and FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY-UNIT are the values which are locally stored on Retransmitting Device.

Samp-Forward-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet: **\| SAMP-FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DATA-OR-ERROR-PACKET-AND-TTL \| OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS \| OPTIONAL-PAYLOAD-SIZE \| PAYLOAD \|**

where SAMP-FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DATA-OR-ERROR-PACKET-AND-TTL is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0]=1, bits[1..3] equal to a 3-bit constant SAMP_FORWARD_TO_SANTA_DATA_OR_ERROR_PACKET, bit [4] being EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT, and bits [5..] being TTL; OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS is present only if EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT is set, and is described above; OPTIONAL-PAYLOAD-SIZE is present only if MORE-PACKETS-FOLLOW flag is set, and is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field; PAYLOAD is data being forwarded (copied from PAYLOAD of Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet).

Samp-Forward-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet is sent by Retransmitting Device when it receives Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet (with TTL=MAX_TTL-1 to account for original Samp-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet). On receiving Samp-Forward-To-Santa-Data-Or-Error-Packet by a Retransmitting Device, it is  processed as described in Uni-Cast processing section above (with implicit Target-Address being Root), and is always sent in 'Guaranteed Uni-Cast' mode.

Samp-Routing-Error-Packet: **\| SAMP-ROUTING-ERROR-PACKET-AND-TTL \| OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS \| ERROR-CODE \| TODO (incl. OPTIONAL-PAYLOAD-SIZE if applicable) \|**

where SAMP-ROUTING-ERROR-PACKET-AND-TTL is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0]=1, bits[1..3] equal to a 3-bit constant SAMP_ROUTING_ERROR_PACKET, bit [4] being EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT, and bits [5..] being TTL; OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS is present only if EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT is set, and is described above.

On receiving Samp-Routing-Error-Packet, it is processed as described in Uni-Cast processing section above (with implicit Target-Address being Root), and is always sent in 'Guaranteed Uni-Cast' mode.

Samp-Route-Update-Packet: **\| SAMP-ROUTE-UPDATE-PACKET-FLAGS-AND-TTL \| OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS \| Target-Address \| OPTIONAL-ORIGINAL-RT-CHECKSUM \| OPTIONAL-MAX-TTL \| OPTIONAL-FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY-UNIT \| OPTIONAL-FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY \| OPTIONAL-MAX-NODE-RANDOM-DELAY-UNIT \| OPTIONAL-MAX-NODE-RANDOM-DELAY \| MODIFICATIONS-LIST \| RESULTING-RT-CHECKSUM \|**

where SAMP-ROUTE-UPDATE-PACKET-FLAGS-AND-TTL is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0]=1, bits[1..3] equal to a 3-bit constant SAMP_ROUTE_UPDATE_PACKET, bit[4] being EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT, and bits[5..] being TTL; OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS is present only if EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT is set, and is described above; Target-Address is the Target-Address field; OPTIONAL-ORIGINAL-RT-CHECKSUM is present only if DISCARD-RT-FIRST flag is not set; OPTIONAL-ORIGINAL-RT-CHECKSUM is a Routing-Table-Checksum, specifying Routing Table checksum before the change is applied; if OPTIONAL-ORIGINAL-RT-CHECKSUM doesn't match to that of the Routing Table - it is TODO Routing-Error; OPTIONAL-MAX-TTL is present only if UPDATE-MAX-TTL flag is present, and is a 1-byte field, OPTIONAL-FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY-UNIT and OPTIONAL-FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY are present only if UPDATE-FORWARD-TO-SANTA-DELAY flag is present, and both are Encoded-Signed-Int<max=2> fields, OPTIONAL-MAX-NODE-RANDOM-DELAY-UNIT and OPTIONAL-MAX-NODE-RANDOM-DELAY are present only if UPDATE-MAX-NODE-RANDOM-DELAY flag is present, and both are Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> fields, MODIFICATIONS-LIST described below; RESULTING-RT-CHECKSUM is a Routing-Table-Checksum, specifying Routing Table Checksum after the change has been applied (if RESULTING-RT-CHECKSUM doesn't match - it is TODO Routing-Error). 

MODIFICATIONS-LIST consists of entries, where each entry is one of the following: 

* **\| ADD-OR-MODIFY-LINK-ENTRY-AND-LINK-ID \| BUS-ID \| NEXT-HOP-ACKS-AND-INTRA-BUS-ID-PLUS-1 \| OPTIONAL-LINK-DELAY-UNIT \| OPTIONAL-LINK-DELAY \| OPTIONAL-LINK-DELAY-ERROR \|**

  where ADD-OR-MODIFY-LINK-ENTRY-AND-LINK-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] marks the end of MODIFICATIONS-LIST, bits[1..2] equal to a 2-bit constant ADD_OR_MODIFY_LINK_ENTRY, bit[3] being LINK-DELAY-PRESENT flag, and bits[4..] equal to LINK-ID; BUS-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field, NEXT-HOP-ACKS-AND-INTRA-BUS-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=4> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] being a NEXT-HOP-ACKS flag for the Routing Table Entry, and bits[1..] representing INTRA-BUS-ID-PLUS-1 (INTRA-BUS-ID-PLUS-1 == 0 means that INTRA-BUS-ID==NULL, and therefore that the link entry is an incoming link entry; otherwise, `INTRA-BUS-ID = INTRA-BUS-ID-PLUS-1 - 1`); OPTIONAL-LINK-DELAY-UNIT, OPTIONAL-LINK-DELAY, and OPTIONAL-LINK-DELAY-ERROR are present only if LINK-DELAY-PRESENT flag is set, and are Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> fields. NB: by default, link delays are not set by Root, and are set based on device's internal per-bus settings.

* **\| DELETE-LINK-ENTRY-AND-LINK-ID \|**

  where DELETE-LINK-ENTRY-AND-LINK-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] marks the end of MODIFICATIONS-LIST, bits[1..2] equal to a 2-bit constant DELETE_LINK_ENTRY, and bits[3..] equal to LINK-ID.

* **\| ADD-OR-MODIFY-ROUTE-ENTRY-AND-LINK-ID \| TARGET-ID \|**

  where ADD-OR-MODIFY-ROUTE-ENTRY-AND-LINK-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] marks the end of MODIFICATIONS-LIST, bits[1..2] equal to a 2-bit constant ADD_OR_MODIFY_ROUTE_ENTRY, and bits[3..] equal to LINK-ID; TARGET-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> field.

* **\| DELETE-ROUTE-ENTRY-AND-TARGET-ID \|**

  where DELETE-ROUTE-ENTRY-AND-TARGET-ID is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0] marks the end of MODIFICATIONS-LIST, bits[1..2] equal to a 2-bit constant DELETE_ROUTE_ENTRY, and bits[3..] equal to TARGET-ID. Note that DELETE-ROUTE-ENTRY-AND-TARGET-ID is the only MODIFICATIONS-LIST entry first field which includes TARGET-ID rather than LINK-ID.

Samp-Route-Update-Packets always go in one direction - from Root to Device; it's Target-Address MUST NOT be 0; it is processed as described in Uni-Cast processing section above, and is always sent in 'Guaranteed Uni-Cast' mode. Samp-Route-Update-Packet MAY be sent either to Retransmitting or to non-Retransmitting Device; however, if sending it to a non-Retransmitting Device, Root MUST be sure that non-Retransmitting Device has it's transmitter turned on (because upper-layer protocol state guarantees it).

Samp-Loop-Ack-Packet: **\| SAMP-LOOP-ACK-AND-TTL \| OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS \| Target-Address \| LOOP-ACK-ID \|**

where SAMP-LOOP-ACK-AND-TTL is an Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate, with bit[0]=1, bits[1..3] equal to a 3-bit constant SAMP_LOOP_ACK_PACKET, bit [4] being EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT, and bits [5..] being TTL; OPTIONAL-EXTRA-HEADERS is present only if EXTRA-HEADERS-PRESENT flag is set, Target-Address is described above, and LOOP-ACK-ID is copied from LOOP-ACK extra header of Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet. 

Samp-Loop-Ack-Packet is generated either by destination, or by the node which has found that the next hop already has NEXT-HOP-ACKS flag (see details in 'Guaranteed Uni-Cast' section above); generating node always specifies itself as a target. 

Samp-Loop-Ack-Packet is processed as specified in 'Uni-cast processing' section above; Samp-Loop-Ack packet is never sent using 'Guaranteed uni-cast' delivery. Processing at the target node (regardless of node type) consists of passing PAYLOAD to the upper-layer protocol.


Type of Samp packet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As described above, type of Samp packet is always defined by bits [0..3] of the first field (which is always Encoded-Unsigned-Int<max=2> bitfield substrate):

+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

Packet Urgency
--------------

From SAMP point of view, all upper-layer-protocol packets can have one of three urgency levels. If the packet has urgency URGENCY_LAZY, it is first sent as a Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet without GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag (as described above, in case of retries it will be resent with GUARANTEED-DELIVERY). If the packet has urgency URGENCY_QUITE_URGENT, it is first sent as a Samp-Unicast-Data-Packet with GUARANTEED-DELIVERY flag (as described above, in case of retries it will be resent as a Samp-\*-Santa-\* packet). If the packet has urgency URGENCY_TRIPLE_GALOP, 
then it is first sent as a Samp-From-Santa-Data-Packet or Samp-To-Santa-Data-Packet (depending on source being Root or Device).
